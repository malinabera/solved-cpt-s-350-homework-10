 <li>Describe a proof that, for any three NP-problems <em>A,B,C</em>, we have</li>

</ol>

<em>A </em>≤<em><sub>m </sub>B </em>and <em>B </em>≤<em><sub>m </sub>C </em>implies <em>A </em>≤<em><sub>m </sub>C</em>.

 <li>Show that the following problem is in NP (that is, you need only describea nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithm that solves the following problem):</li>

Given: a directed graph <em>G</em>,

Question: is there a path on <em>G </em>such that every node of <em>G </em>is covered exactly once?

Given: a directed graph <em>G</em>,

Question: is there a path on <em>G </em>such that every node of <em>G </em>is covered?

<ol start="4">

 <li>Let <em>C </em>be a Boolean circuit (using AND, NOT, OR gates), which has input (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub><em>,</em>··<em>,x<sub>n</sub></em>) and one output <em>y</em>. The circuit is satisfiable if for some input, the output <em>y </em>produced by <em>C </em>is 1. Suppose that we have a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that decides whether <em>C </em>is satisfiable.</li>

</ol>

Now, let <em>C</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>C</em><sub>2 </sub>be two Boolean circuits (using AND, NOT, OR gates), each of which has input (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub><em>,</em>···<em>,x<sub>n</sub></em>) and one output <em>y</em>. We say that the two circuits are equivalent if for any input, the output produced by <em>C</em><sub>1 </sub>equals the the output produced by <em>C</em><sub>2</sub>.

Show that we also have a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that decides whether <em>C</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>C</em><sub>2 </sub>are equivalent.
